# Neural Network Concepts in the Sudoku Solver

Here are the key places where neural network concepts are used in the Sudoku solver project:

1. **Model Architecture**
   - In the `build_simple_digit_model()` function, a neural network with specific layers is created
   - The model uses a feed-forward architecture with dense (fully connected) layers
   - Includes a hidden layer with ReLU activation and dropout for regularization
   - Output layer uses softmax activation for multi-class classification (digits 0-9)

2. **Training Process**
   - The MNIST dataset (handwritten digits) is used for training
   - The model learns to recognize handwritten digits through supervised learning
   - Uses backpropagation with the Adam optimizer to update weights
   - Minimizes sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function
   - Employs mini-batch training with a batch size of 128

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Images are normalized (divided by 255) to scale pixel values between 0 and 1
   - Input images are reshaped to include a channel dimension (required for the model)
   - Training data is split into training and validation sets for performance monitoring

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy is used as the evaluation metric during training
   - Validation data helps prevent overfitting during training

5. **Inference / Prediction**
   - In the `extract_digits()` function, the trained model is used to predict digits
   - Each Sudoku cell is preprocessed similarly to the training data
   - Model outputs probabilities for each possible digit (0-9)
   - The digit with highest probability is selected as the prediction
   - A confidence threshold (prediction > 0.5) is used to filter uncertain predictions

6. **Model Persistence**
   - Trained model is saved to disk to avoid retraining
   - Model weights and architecture are preserved for future use

When explaining to your teacher, you could emphasize that this project demonstrates:
- Practical application of neural networks for image recognition
- The complete machine learning workflow (data prep → training → evaluation → inference)
- Integration of neural networks with traditional algorithms (the Sudoku solver)
- How transfer learning concepts are applied (using a model trained on MNIST to recognize digits in a new context)

The neural network essentially functions as the "eyes" of the system, converting the visual input (Sudoku grid image) into a digital format that the solving algorithm can work with.
